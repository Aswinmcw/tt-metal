## Developing tt-metal

Currently, the most convenient way to develop is to do so on our cloud
machines. They have prerequisite dependencies, model files, and other settings
set up for users.

Please refer to the [initial Getting Started
page](docs/source/get_started/installation.rst) then please read the the
[developer's page](docs/source/dev_onboarding/get_started.rst).
