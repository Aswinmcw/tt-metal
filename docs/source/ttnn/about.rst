What is TTNN?
#############

TTNN is a Python library that provides a user-friendly interface to ``TT-METAL``.
The TTNN library assumes the user is familiar with `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and provides
operations that easily translate `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ tensors to ``ttnn.Tensor(s)``.
TTNN's primary dependency is :doc:`TT-LIB </ttnn/dependencies/tt_lib>`.

We trust that this library will be valuable to helping you on your journey to take full advantage of our devices!
