Tutorials
=========

This is a collection of tutorials written with Jupyter Notebooks to help you ramp up your skillset for using `tt-metal`. These
notebooks can be found under https://github.com/tenstorrent-metal/tt-metal/tree/main/ttnn/tutorials.

These tutorials assume you already have a machine set up with either a grayskull or wormhole device available and that you have successfully
followed the instructions for `installing and building the software <https://github.com/tenstorrent-metal/tt-metal/blob/main/README.md>`_.

From within the `ttnn/tutorials` directory, launch the notebooks with: `jupyter lab --no-browser --port=8888`
